# AltoFuse
A decentralized Music Platform (Web and App) that will use InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Blockchain to store the music files of creators and will allow collaboration of various Instrumentalists/vocalists to collaborate and contribute towards the formation of a musical masterpiece that can be listed on the platform as a Non- Fungible Token (ERC 721) available for the public or to be auctioned to a music label or a collector. Our ownership smart-contract protocol will allow multiple contributors to receive their fair share of ownership rights of the music track and will receive funds accordingly.
